# Permutation
Permutation using lexicographic ordering in Python3.<br />
Created with dependant functions, theres two versions a version using built-in libraries within Python and one without.<br />
Feel free to use and play around with the code as you wish.<br />
Note that there's already a lib in python that does this, you can find it in "itertools" lib -> permutations() function.<br />
I just built my own i was just curious and bored i guess :D<br />
